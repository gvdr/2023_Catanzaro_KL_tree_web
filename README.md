# Introduction

Phylogenetic Signal testing for ecological network is important, but is hard.

Current methods work mostly for bipartite, or are model based.

We don't have a model for unipartite food webs.

So, here we propose a method based on Information Theory.

Dkl. Minimal Evolution. Interpretation as surprise.

Surprising species.

# Methods

From phylogeny to distance matrix to distribution.

From ecological networks to distance matrix (through RDPG) to distribution.

Compute Dkl of the two distributions.

Permanova by reshuffling tips on tree.

Decomposition on species level.
