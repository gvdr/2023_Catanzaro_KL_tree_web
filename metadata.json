  "abstract": "Detecting and analysing the role of macro-evolutionary processes in the structure of ecological networks is challenging, particularly for unipartite food webs. Current methods are either model-based, or relying on linear interactions, and provide limited information on the role of single species. Here, we propose a novel approach, building on Information Theory and providing a meaningful interpretation in terms of Minimal Evolution, to test for phylogenetic signal in unipartite food webs. Moreover, we show how that can be used to identify surprising species: species that have an unexpected peculiar ecological role, given their evolutionary history. We apply our methodology to two large food webs, and discuss the results." ,
